	First, you want to install Allegro. You can use the package manager bundled with your distribution and search for "Allegro", but in some distributions you'll have troubles with outdated repositories. I recommend the version 5.2.4, so if your package manager allows you to download that version or similar (5.2.x), do it. If you don't want to miss the bullet, check <a href="https://wiki.allegro.cc/index.php?title=Install_Allegro5_From_Git/Linux/Debian">this tutorial</a> to find out how to compile it from sources. You'll need <i>git</i> and <i>cmake</i>. 
	
	Once Allegro is installed in your system, clone the <a href="https://github.com/EnricRG/PID-UdG">GitHub repository</a> with 
	@code git clone https://github.com/EnricRG/PID-UdG @endcode
	@image html git_clone.png
	And run <i>make</i> on <i>/PID-UdG/installation/Linux/</i>. 
	@image html make.png
	This will generate a file called <i>libWindowAddon.so</i>. Take that file and put it inside <i>/usr/lib/</i> folder, or somewhere the compiler can find it. You'll need root privileges if you decide to move it somewhere on your root.

	Next, you must put the headers somewhere the compiler can find them. The headers are inside the <i>include</i> folder. My recommendation is to put them into <i>/usr/include</i>. Remember that you need root privileges to be able to perform this action.

	<br>
	And that's it, you have <b>successfully installed</b> our library. Don't forget to link your executables to the corresponding Allegro libraries to get your applications compiled. 
	<br><br>
	A simple and very practical way of doing this is using pkg-config. Inside <i>/PID-UdG/installation/Linux/</i> you have a directory called <i>test</i>. There you have a simple code and a Makefile to compile it. Check those files to see how to compile with this add-on.

	If it compiles, run it. You should see a thin black circle on a white screen with a little text on it.
	
	@section linux_codeblocks Linux and Code::Blocks
	
	It would be a wise decision to use and IDE if you're starting on programming or if you want a more user-friendly interface to develop your projects. I'll show here how to set-up Code::Blocks to be able to compile and link both Allegro and the Window Add-on. This can be extrapolated to more IDEs.
	
	It's simple, you only have to show the compiler where to find the library files and how to use them:
	<ol>
	
	<li>
	Open Code::Blocks. Go to <b><i>Compiler...</i></b> settings under the <b><i>Settings</i></b> tab.

	</li>
	
	<li>
	Go to <b><i>Linker Settings</i></b> and add all these files and compilation flags (<i>-lallegro -lallegro_primitives -lallegro_image -lallegro_font -lallegro_ttf -lWindowAddon</i>):<br>
	<b>Attention</b>: Depending on the source of your Allegro package, the path to the files could be different. To check where they are, you can use the command 
	@code whereis liballegro.so @endcode
	and so on.

	</li>
	
	<li>
	Go to <b><i>Search directories</i></b> tab and add the folders that contain the headers of both libraries:

	</li>
	
	And it's done. Now you can compile your own code using Allegro or WindowAddon with Code::Blocks.
	
	</ol>
