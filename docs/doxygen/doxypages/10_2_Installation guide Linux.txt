	First, you want to install Allegro. Check <a href="https://wiki.allegro.cc/index.php?title=Install_Allegro5_From_Git/Linux/Debian">this tutorial</a> to find out how. You'll need <i>git</i> and <i>cmake</i>. You can also use the package manager bundled with your distribution and search for "Allegro". I recommend the version 5.2.4.
	
	Once Allegro is installed in your system, clone the <a href="https://github.com/EnricRG/PID-UdG">GitHub repository</a> with 
	@code git clone https://github.com/EnricRG/PID-UdG @endcode and run <i>make</i> on the main directory.

	This will generate a file called libWindowAddon.so. Take that file and put it inside /usr/lib/ folder, or somewhere the compiler can find it.

	Next, you must put the headers somewhere the compiler can find them. The headers are inside the <i>include</i> folder. My recommendation is to put them into <i>/usr/include</i>.

	And that’s it, you have successfully installed my library. Don’t forget to link your executables to the corresponding Allegro libraries to get your applications compiled.

	A simple and very practical way of doing this is using pkg-config. Inside the downloaded files you have a directory called test. There you have a simple code and a Makefile to compile it. Check those files to see how to compile with this add-on.

	If it compiles, run it. You should see a thin black circle on a white screen.
