	First, you want to install Allegro. You can use the package manager bundled with your distribution and search for "Allegro", but in some distributions you'll have troubles with outdated repositories. I recommend the version 5.2.4, so if your package manager allows you to download that version or similar (5.2.x), do it. If you don't want to miss the bullet, check <a href="https://wiki.allegro.cc/index.php?title=Install_Allegro5_From_Git/Linux/Debian">this tutorial</a> to find out how to compile it from sources. You'll need <i>git</i> and <i>cmake</i>. 
	
	Once Allegro is installed in your system, clone the <a href="https://github.com/EnricRG/PID-UdG">GitHub repository</a> with 
	@code git clone https://github.com/EnricRG/PID-UdG @endcode

	And run <i>make</i> on <i>/PID-UdG/installation/Linux/</i>. 
	@image html make.png
	This will generate a file called <i>libWindowAddon.so</i>. Take that file and put it inside <i>/usr/lib/</i> folder, or somewhere the compiler can find it. You'll need root privileges if you decide to move it somewhere on your root.

	Next, you must put the headers somewhere the compiler can find them. The headers are inside the <i>include</i> folder. My recommendation is to put them into <i>/usr/include</i>. Remember that you need root privileges to be able to perform this action.

	And that's it, you have <b>successfully installed</b> our library. Don't forget to link your executables to the corresponding Allegro libraries to get your applications compiled. 
	<br><br>
	A simple and very practical way of doing this is using pkg-config. Inside <i>/PID-UdG/installation/Linux/</i> you have a directory called <i>test</i>. There you have a simple code and a Makefile to compile it. Check those files to see how to compile with this add-on.

	If it compiles, run it. You should see a thin black circle on a white screen with a little text on it.
