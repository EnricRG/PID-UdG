	First, you want to install Allegro. Check <a href="https://wiki.allegro.cc/index.php?title=Install_Allegro5_From_Git/Linux/Debian">this tutorial</a> to find out how. You'll need <i>git</i> and <i>cmake</i>.
	
	Once allegro is installed in your system, clone the <a href="https://github.com/EnricRG/PID-UdG">GitHub repository</a> with 
	@code git clone https://github.com/EnricRG/PID-UdG @endcode and run <i>make</i> on the main directory.

	This will generate a file called libWindowAddon.so. Take that file and put it inside /usr/lib/ folder, or somewhere that the compiler can find it.

	Next, you must put the headers somewhere the compiler can find them. The headers are inside the include folder. My recommendation is to put them into /usr/include.

	And that’s it, you have successfully installed my library. Don’t forget to link your executables to the corresponding Allegro libraries to get your applications compiled.

	A simple and very practical way of doing this is using pkg-config. Inside the downloaded files you have a directory called test. There you have a simple code and a Makefile to compile it. Check that to see how to compile with this addon.

	If it compiles, run it. You should see a thin black circle on a white screen.
