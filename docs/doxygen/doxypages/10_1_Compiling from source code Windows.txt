	<b>Prerequisites</b>: Allegro (recommended version: 5.2.4) must be installed on your MinGW installation first.
	<br><br>
	The objective of this tutorial is to teach you how to create both <i>windowAddon.dll</i> and <i>windowAddon.a</i> files needed to install the add-on to your MinGW installation. We will be using Code::Blocks to generate them.
	<br><br>
	Follow this steps in order to compile them from the source code:
	<ol>
		<li>
			Download the source code from the <a href="https://github.com/EnricRG/PID-UdG"> GitHub repository</a>. The source code is located inside <i>src</i> folder.
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Make sure that you set Code::Blocks MinGW path to be the MinGW installation where you want to install the Window Add-on. Go to <i>Settings &rarr; Compiler &rarr; Toolchain executables</i> to check that out.

		</li>
		
		<li>
			Go to <i>File &rarr; New &rarr; Project</i> and create a <i>Dynamic Link Library</i> Project. Name it "WindowAddon". If you don't name it like this, you'll have to modify the name of the final compiled files.

		</li>
		
		<li>
			Make a copy of the Window Add-on sources into the root of this new project and put it in a directory called <i>windowAddon</i>. You can not choose this name, make sure you type it right.

		</li>
		
		<li>
			Replace your main.h and main.cpp with this samples:
			<br><br>
			<i>main.h</i>
			@include dll_main.h
			<i>main.cpp</i>
			@include dll_main.cpp
			<br>
			In more detail: First of all, you have to include the headers that you want to be accessible when using the library. You also have to delete the sample function that Code::Blocks creates with the project. The provided samples are the ones intended to be used, but feel free to modify anything you want in order to fit your needs.
		</li>
		
		<li>
			Compile the project. Make sure you have selected the <i><b>Release</b></i> build option and click <i><b>Rebuild</b></i> to compile it from zero (to ensure you are not using some intermediate files that have been created during a possible test compile). You'll see some warnings coming from <i>CommonUtils.h</i> and <i>Event.h</i>, but this is fine.
		</li>
		
		<li>
			Now you should see three files inside <i>bin/Release</i> directory of the project named <i>windowAddon.a, windowAddon.dll and windowAddon.def</i>. We're interested in the first two.

			Create a directory named <i>bin</i> inside your installation files folder and put <i>windowAddon.dll</i> in it. Do the same with <i>windowAddon.a</i> but in a folder called <i>lib</i>. Now your installation files folder should look like that:

		</li>		
	</ol>
	
	And that's it. Now you can continue to @ref installing_windowaddon_windows to finish your installation process.
