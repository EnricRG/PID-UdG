		It's known that <strong>MSI Afterburner</strong> produces crashes when destroying a Window and then creating a new one. It's a bug present in the interaction between Afterburner and the core of Allegro library, and has nothing to do with the Window Add-on.
		This can happen when you explicitly delete a Window and then create a new one, or even if a Window that has been created inside a function that has finished its scope is destroyed implicitly.
		<br><br>
		<strong>Solution: </strong> Close MSI Afterburner when running programs that can exhibit this behavior.
