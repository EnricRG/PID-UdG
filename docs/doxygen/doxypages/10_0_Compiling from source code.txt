@page compilation_guides Compile WindowAddon from sources
	If you want to have the most recent version of the add-on compiled for any version of MinGW/GCC you want, you came to the right place. Here you have the tutorials to compile the binary files from the source code of the library:
	
	<ul>
		<li> Compiling instructions for Windows: @subpage compile_windowaddon_windows </li>
		<li> Compiling instructions for Linux: @subpage compile_windowaddon_linux </li>
	</ul>
	
	This tutorials focus on generating the installation files, but not to install them. You should check the @ref installation_guides to complete your installation process.
