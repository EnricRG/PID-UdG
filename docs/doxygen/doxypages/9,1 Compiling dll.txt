@subpage compile_windowaddon_windows compiling Window Addon dll 
	<strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Allegro (recommended version: 5.2.4) installed on your MinGW installation.
	<br><br>
	
	Follow this steps in order to compile windowAddon.dll from the source code:
	<ol>
	
	<li>
		Go to File --> New --> Project and create a Dynamic Link Library Project. Choose the name and path you prefer, but you have to remember it. In my case the name will be "WindowAddon1.1".

	</li>
	
	<li>
		Make a copy of the WindowAddon sources into the root of this new project and put it in a directory called windowAddon. This name is not random, make sure you type it right.

	</li>
	
	<li>
		Now replace your main.h and main.cpp with this samples:
		<br><br>
		<i>main.h</i>
		@include dll_main.h
		<i>main.cpp</i>
		@include dll_main.cpp
		<br>
		In more detail: First of all, you have to include the headers that you want to be accessible when using the library. You also have to delete the sample function that Code::Blocks creates with the project. The provided samples are the ones intended to use, but feel free to modify anything you want to fit your needs.
